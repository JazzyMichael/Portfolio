# Portfolio Site!

Kept it very simple using create-react-app and hosted on Firebase.

Added some cool features including a terminal component and fancy background image cross-fading.

Data for projects, skills, about, etc... is stored in a constants file and sections are split into components.

Couldn't resist adding a cat pic.
